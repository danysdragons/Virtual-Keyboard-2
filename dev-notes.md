Here's a tidier version of your ChatGPT conversation:

User:
Generate a virtual keyboard that can play:
1. Has at least two octaves of notes
2. Has two options for controlling note duration:
a) Has an option to play notes normally, clicking and having it last a realistic duration, but also playing it as long as it's held
b) has an option to sustain a note until its intentionally stopped, *without* requiring holding a key or keeping a cursor in place.
3. Selection among several virtual instruments with realistic sounds.
4. Selection among types of pure tones as well
5. Display names of notes

ChatGPT:
I’ve put a complete, single-file virtual keyboard in the canvas. It has:

Two octaves (C4–B5) with labeled keys

Two play modes:

Normal: a quick click rings for a realistic length; holding sustains while held

Latch sustain: click to start, click again to stop (no holding required)

Realistic sampled instruments (SoundFont) plus pure tone oscillators

Volume + adjustable default “ring” length

Stop-All control

You can save the HTML and open it in any modern browser. If you’d like MIDI keyboard input, computer-key mappings, or a 3–4 octave option, I can add those as well — or feel free to just ask your next question.

ChatGPT:
Thanks for the stack trace—that helped. I’ve rewritten the canvas code to fix the ReferenceError: Soundfont is not defined by:

Dynamically loading soundfont-player with robust checks and a fallback CDN.

Waiting until the library is confirmed loaded before calling Soundfont.instrument.

Gracefully falling back to pure Web Audio oscillators if the library can’t be loaded (so the keyboard still works).

Adding a “Run self-test” button that verifies: library presence, instrument loading, oscillator baseline, and latch/stop logic. The diagnostics appear in the log panel.

A quick check on your expectations: if the SoundFont library can’t load (e.g., offline, blocked CDN), do you want me to automatically switch to a specific pure tone (like sine) and keep the selected “Sampled instrument” highlighted, or should I visually switch the dropdown to a pure tone to make the fallback explicit? I can also add a small banner when it falls back, if that’s preferable.

User:
visually switch the dropdown to a pure tone to make the fallback explicit, and also add a small banner.

ChatGPT:
Done. I updated the app so that if SoundFont can’t be used (library missing or instrument load fails), it:

Visually switches the dropdown to “Pure: Sine”

Shows a small banner explaining the fallback

Keeps working via oscillator tones

I also added a UI self-test that simulates the fallback and verifies the dropdown switch in the log.

If you want a dismiss (×) on the banner or an option to pick a different default pure tone after fallback, I can add that — or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
I'm looking to troubleshoot the problem that led to the need to fallback to oscillators. Refer to the text below from another ChatGPT chat where I asked for feedback on this issue. Use an option that doesn't require any package installation.

----

See the error log from this app I'm making. Can you suggest alternative sound libraries to play instrument sounds, it's currently forced to fall back to pure sine waves and whatnot.

ChatGPT said:

It looks like the app is falling back to a sine wave because it's having trouble loading the Soundfont Player. To avoid this, you could try alternative libraries like Tone.js with Sampler, WebAudioFont by Surikov, or Magenta.js, which also supports soundfonts. Other options include WAD.js, Pizzicato.js, and Howler.js for sample playback.

You could try alternatives like "sf2synth.js" or "TinySoundFont" for SF2 SoundFonts and WebAssembly synthesis. Other options include "FluidSynth" compiled to WASM or "sfizz" as an experimental WASM solution. To avoid CDN issues, you can self-host or prefetch libraries like Tone.js with sample packs. I can provide integration code with explicit instructions!

I suggest using "Tone.js Sampler" with samples like "Pianobook", or integrating "Howler.js" with a sample pack. For WebAudio, "WebAudioFont" or "webaudio-tinysynth" might be good options. "FluidSynth WASM" could also work well for SF2 compatibility. I'll provide code snippets for sample mapping, normal/latch sustain, and integration steps.

I suggest exploring both sample-based playback and SF2 soundfont synthesis. Additionally, there are options like wavetables, physical modeling, and WebAssembly-compiled synths like Dexed and ZynAddSubFX (though they're a bit experimental in web versions). For reliable performance, we can also use multiple CDN fallbacks and offline caching with Service Workers. I'll suggest prefetching code and optimizing CDN usage.

The issue: "Soundfont-player" isn't loading from unpkg. We can migrate to npm or use a CDN fallback like jsDelivr. Here's a breakdown of options for instrument playback:

WebAudio-TinySynth: fast GM synthesis but synthetic.

js-synthesizer + SF2: higher quality but needs Wasm setup.

Tone.js Sampler: versatile, best for high-quality instruments.

Howler.js: simple, good for basic samples.

WebAudioFont: streaming-based SoundFont support.

Additional recommendations: implement a toggle interface to switch synth engines. Here’s example code for Tone.js and Howler.js. Consider implementing an offline sample cache via Service Workers for smoother playback.

Code snippets for Tone.js example:

```js
import * as Tone from 'tone';

// Tone.js Sampler setup
const piano = new Tone.Sampler({
  urls: {
    C4: 'C4.mp3',
    E4: 'E4.mp3',
    G4: 'G4.mp3',
    C5: 'C5.mp3'
  },
  release: 1,
  baseUrl: '/samples/piano/'
}).toDestination();

await Tone.start(); // User trigger
await piano.loaded;

function noteOn(note, vel=0.8) { piano.triggerAttack(note, Tone.now(), vel); }
function noteOff(note) { piano.triggerRelease(note, Tone.now()); }
```
**Code for Howler.js

Done

ChatGPT:
Totally—your error looks like the CDN import for soundfont-player failed, so your app fell back to pure oscillators. Here are solid alternatives (plus quick, copy-pasteable snippets) so you can keep “real” instruments without relying on that one library/CDN.

1) Tone.js (Sampler / Players) — flexible + well-maintained
Best for: realistic, low-latency, multi-sample instruments; envelopes; effects.
How it works: you provide a few samples (e.g., every 3–5 semitones) and Tone handles pitch-shifting, envelopes, and polyphony.

```ts
// npm i tone
import * as Tone from "tone";

const audioReady = async () => {
  // must be called from a user gesture on iOS/Safari
  await Tone.start();
};

const piano = new Tone.Sampler({
  urls: {
    C4: "C4.mp3",
    E4: "E4.mp3",
    G4: "G4.mp3",
    C5: "C5.mp3"
  },
  release: 1.2,
  baseUrl: "/samples/piano/" // your own hosted samples
}).toDestination();

await piano.loaded;

export function noteOn(note: string, velocity = 0.9) {
  piano.triggerAttack(note, undefined, velocity);
}
export function noteOff(note: string) {
  piano.triggerRelease(note);
}

// “Latch sustain” UX (click-on/click-off)
const latched = new Set<string>();
export function toggleLatch(note: string, velocity = 0.9) {
  if (latched.has(note)) {
    noteOff(note);
    latched.delete(note);
  } else {
    noteOn(note, velocity);
    latched.add(note);
  }
}
```
Pros

Great DX, effects chain, scheduling.

You control the sample quality (e.g., Salamander piano, MusyngKite GM sets, etc.).

No dependency on third-party SoundFont parsing.

Cons

You host the samples; initial load size is on you (mitigate with a few root samples + lazy loading).

2) WebAudioFont (GM palette in JS) — instant General MIDI
Best for: quick drop-in with lots of instruments and minimal setup.

```html
<!-- npm i webaudiofont or use a prebuilt bundle you host -->
<script type="module">
  import { WebAudioFontPlayer } from "webaudiofont";

  const audio = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
  const player = new WebAudioFontPlayer();

  // load one preset (example: Acoustic Grand Piano)
  // You’ll serve the preset js files yourself to avoid CDN issues.
  import "/webaudiofont/presets/0000_AcousticGrandPiano.js"; // defines _tone_0000_AcousticGrandPiano
  const preset = window._tone_0000_AcousticGrandPiano;

  function noteOn(midi: number, velocity = 100) {
    player.queueWaveTable(audio, audio.destination, preset, audio.currentTime, midi, 3, velocity/127);
  }
  function noteOff(midi: number) {
    // WebAudioFont notes auto-stop after duration; for true gate control, queue a short duration and retrigger.
  }
</script>
```
Pros

Huge GM coverage out of the box.

No separate SF2 files; works fully in WebAudio.

Cons

Many presets are lightweight/GM-style rather than deeply sampled realism.

3) webaudio-tinysynth — tiny, self-contained GM synth
Best for: small footprint, reliable fallback with many instrument IDs.

```html
<script type="module">
  import WebAudioTinySynth from "webaudio-tinysynth"; // npm i webaudio-tinysynth

  const synth = new WebAudioTinySynth({ quality: 1 }); // 0..3
  // MIDI-style API:
  function midiNoteOn(ch = 0, midi = 60, vel = 100) { synth.send([0x90 + ch, midi, vel]); }
  function midiNoteOff(ch = 0, midi = 60)          { synth.send([0x80 + ch, midi, 0]);   }
</script>
```
Pros

Very small, zero assets, no CDN.

GM program changes available.

Cons

Synthetic GM timbres (not sample-based realism).

4) SoundFont via WASM (higher fidelity, single .sf2 asset)
Best for: loading a real .sf2 and letting a synth render it client-side.

Options: js-synthesizer, fluidsynth-wasm (both render SF2 with WebAudio).
Pros: one file per instrument/bank; realistic; no multi-sample mapping.
Cons: more CPU than pure sample playback; slightly more setup.

(If you want this route, I can wire a minimal js-synthesizer example around your key events; it’s a good middle ground when you want GM quality without curating sample folders.)

A quick fix for your current approach (if you still like SoundFonts)
Even if you stay with soundfont-player, avoid brittle CDN tags:

Install and bundle:
npm i soundfont-player
import Soundfont from "soundfont-player"; (let Vite/Rollup bundle it)

Or implement a multi-CDN fallback (unpkg → jsDelivr) and/or self-host the dist/ file.

Preload and cache with a Service Worker so instruments work offline.

Minimal SW cache idea:

```js
// sw.js
self.addEventListener("install", e => {
  e.waitUntil(caches.open("v1").then(c => c.addAll([
    "/dist/soundfont-player.min.js",
    "/samples/piano/C4.mp3", "/samples/piano/E4.mp3", "/samples/piano/G4.mp3", "/samples/piano/C5.mp3"
  ])));
});
self.addEventListener("fetch", e => {
  e.respondWith(caches.match(e.request).then(r => r || fetch(e.request)));
});
```
Which should you choose?
Want “real instrument” vibe with control & effects? → Tone.js Sampler (host a lean set of high-quality samples; you’ll get the best sound).

Need lots of instruments quickly for a GM-style keyboard? → WebAudioFont or webaudio-tinysynth (fastest to ship; no external assets).

Prefer a single file per instrument and don’t mind a WASM synth? → js-synthesizer / fluidsynth-wasm (great compromise).

Before I fine-tune the defaults: what’s your expected behavior if SoundFont loads but individual instruments fail (e.g., one preset URL 404s)—should we auto-fallback to WebAudioFont for the same instrument name, or keep the current “explicit pure-tone” fallback and just log the WAF option in the banner? I can also do both if you’re interested, or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
Do both for now, with an prominent toggleable option. This exposes technical details an end-user wouldn't understand, so I should probably keep the toggle between options only temporary.

ChatGPT:
All set. I implemented both behaviors with a clear, temporary toggle:

When a sampled engine fails, the app now tries the other sampled engine first (SoundFont ⇄ WebAudioFont) and only then falls back to pure tones.

The banner becomes prominent on any failure and includes temporary “Engine” buttons:

Try SoundFont

Try WebAudioFont

Use Pure Tones

Switching via the banner is session-only (no persistence), so end users won’t be stuck in a technical mode later.

The dropdown visibly updates to match whichever engine is active, so the state is always explicit.

I also fixed a couple of fragilities from earlier edits (no stray placeholders; clean optgroups) and kept the self-test panel. If you want me to add a 10–15s temporary “troubleshooting mode” that auto-hides the banner after inactivity, I can add that — or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
Working much better now, thanks!

Switching over to other improvments now.

UI improvements to action immediately:
1. Add one more octave below C4.
2. Reference screenshot of just part of the UI. In the top part with "🎵
Notice" (diagnostic and fallback purposes), buttons contrast well with background. In the bottom part with normal UI controls: the "Sound source" dropdown, the "Stop All" button, the "Run self-test" button, the controls don't stand out enough from the background; make them stick out a bit more, but don't alter the appearance of these controls *too* much or change the background of the section. Also avoid changing the background of the Notice section.

Question for discussion before making changes:
- Should the notice section near the top and the diagnostics log near the bottom be made adjacent to each other, or is the current layout fine as-is?

ChatGPT:
Got it—thanks for the screenshot and the concrete asks.

Quick heads-up: I tried to update the canvas to (a) add the extra octave and (b) bump contrast on the main controls, but the canvas tool rejected my patch because one of my search patterns didn’t match the exact text in your document (and an earlier step tried to replace a line with the same content). Net result: no changes were written yet.

Here’s exactly what I was going to change—these are small, safe edits if you want to tweak them manually now, or I can re-apply them for you:

1) Add one more octave below C4 (new range C3–B5)

Change the keyboard width to fit 3 octaves (21 white keys):

Find:
`width: calc(14 * var(--white-w));`
Replace with:
`width: calc(21 * var(--white-w));`

Extend the note range:

Find:
`const startMIDI = 60; // C4`
Replace with:
`const startMIDI = 48; // C3`

Update the aria label (optional but nice for accessibility):

Find: `aria-label="Two-octave keyboard from C4 to B5"`
Replace with: `aria-label="Three-octave keyboard from C3 to B5"`

(Optional) Update the visible title text so it matches:

In `<h1>…</h1>` and the `<title>…</title>`, change “2 Octaves” → “3 Octaves”.

2) Make the bottom controls stand out a bit more (without changing section backgrounds)

Add this CSS near your existing styles. It only targets the main control panel (so it won’t touch the Notice banner buttons):

```css
/* Emphasize controls in the main panel without changing section backgrounds */
#controls select,
#controls button,
#controls input[type="range"]{
  background:#0f1720;             /* slightly lighter for contrast */
  border-color:#2a3a4a;            /* higher contrast border */
  box-shadow:
    0 0 0 1px #2a3a4a,
    0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.35),
    inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.03);
}
#controls button{ font-weight:600; }
#controls select:hover,
#controls button:hover{ filter:brightness(1.08); }
#controls select:focus-visible,
#controls button:focus-visible,
#controls input[type="range"]:focus-visible{
  outline:2px solid #5cc6ff;
  outline-offset:2px;
}
```

3) Add quick self-test for the new range (sanity check)

Append this to the end of your `runSelfTest()` function:

```js
// Test 6: Keyboard range (3 octaves C3..B5)
try {
  const first = document.querySelector('[data-note="C3"]');
  const last  = document.querySelector('[data-note="B5"]');
  if (first && last) log('DOM keys present: C3 .. B5');
  else               log('Expected DOM keys C3 and/or B5 not found', false);

  const whites = document.querySelectorAll('#keyboard .white').length;
  if (whites === 21) log('White key count OK: 21 (3 octaves)');
  else               log('White key count expected 21, got ' + whites, false);
} catch (err) {
  log('DOM range test raised: ' + err.message, false);
}
```

Layout question (discussion)

Should the top notice area and the bottom diagnostics log be adjacent?

My take: keep them separate by default. The notice is transient and user-facing; the diagnostics log is technical. Putting them together can make the top of the UI feel noisy during normal use.

Two light-touch options if you want tighter linkage without clutter:

Add a “Show details” link in the banner that reveals/scrolls to the diagnostics panel.

When the banner is visible, temporarily show a compact inline summary (“Last error: …”), with a “View full log” button that jumps down.

Either way preserves the clean top area for typical users while keeping debugging one click away.

If you want, I can apply the above edits directly to the canvas in one go, or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
Please apply the edits related to 1-3, and I'll consider the layout discssion suggestions further.

ChatGPT:
Done! I applied the edits:

Added one octave below C4

Range is now C3–B5.

Keyboard width updated to 21 white keys.

Title and aria-label updated to reflect “3 Octaves.”

Increased contrast of the main controls (panel with “Sound source,” “Stop All,” “Run self-test,” sliders)

Slightly lighter control surfaces, higher-contrast borders, subtle outer+inner shadows.

Focus rings added for better accessibility.

Notice banner styling unchanged.

Added self-test coverage for the new range

Test validates presence of C3 and B5 and checks that there are 21 white keys.

If you’d like, I can also add a “Show details” link in the banner that reveals/scrolls to the diagnostics log, or we can leave the layout as-is for now—either way works. I can also do a gentle auto-hide on the banner after inactivity if you’re interested, or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
Great! We'll leave it as-is for now.

UI enhancement:
- Dropdown allowing selection from major or minor scales, or no scale selected. Scale selection should show the notes belonging to the scale unobtrusively on the piano keys themselves, perhaps a small blue dot? Note how the white keys and black keys would require different styling.

ChatGPT:
Added! You now have scale-aware highlighting:

New controls in the main panel: Scale key (C…B) and Scale type (None / Major / Minor).

Keys belonging to the selected scale show a small blue dot on the key face:

Styled differently on white vs black keys for contrast.

Unobtrusive, doesn’t interfere with active/pressed visuals.

Markers update instantly when you change either dropdown.

Self-test now includes a check that C major marks C3 (but not C#3).

If you’d like variants (harmonic/melodic minor, Dorian, pentatonic, etc.) or alternative marker styles (underlines, corner ticks, colored keybeds), I can add those as options, or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
Note error: "ReferenceError: Uncaught Reference Error: $1 is not defined."

There is still some display errors. In the example shown in the screenshot of just part of the UI, Scale type is Major and Scale Key has C selected, but the keys highlighted by blue dots are only E and B.

Also, it would be better to have the scale type selection appear before the scale key.

ChatGPT:
Thanks for the precise report — I tracked down and fixed the issues you saw:

Fixes applied

ReferenceError $1: removed the stray $1 placeholder and restored a proper section header, so the script executes cleanly again.

Scale dots only on E and B: that was occlusion by black keys (they sit over the top of adjacent whites). I moved the white-key scale dot lower on the key face (bottom: 28px) so it’s visible for all scale notes. Black-key dots stay at the top.

Control order: swapped the Scale type and Scale key controls so type appears first, as requested.

If you want a subtler marker alternative (e.g., tiny corner tick, thin underline near the label, or a translucent glow), I can add a style toggle, or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
1. Let's rethink the controls immediately above the keyboard. Currrently the controls intermingle the sound source, playback options, and note highlighting options. Suggest a few different options for redesigning this part of the UI to make it cleaner.

2. Change app title to reflect current three octave display.

3. For the app as a whole, are there any other improvement opportunities you can suggest?

ChatGPT:
Awesome—here are some clean ways to reorganize the controls just above the keyboard, plus quick notes on the title and broader improvement ideas.

1) Cleaner layouts for the control area

Here are three solid patterns; each keeps the Notice banner and the diagnostics panel unchanged.

Option A — Three compact groups in one row (“Sound • Play • Guide”)

Sound: Sound source dropdown + Volume + Stop All

Play: Mode (Normal/Latch) + Default length (only enabled in Normal)

Guide: Scale type + Scale key + (legend: “● scale notes”)

Visual: lightweight vertical dividers between groups; keep the current panel background. Pills become small tooltips.

Pros: fastest to implement; minimal change; everything visible.

Cons: Can feel dense on mobile unless it wraps well.

Option B — Segmented tabs (“Sound / Play / Guide”)

Three tabs right above the keyboard. Default tab = Sound.

Each tab reveals only its controls:

Sound: instrument/engine dropdowns, volume, Stop All.

Play: mode + default length + Run self-test.

Guide: scale type/key + a tiny legend.

Pros: cleanest visually; least cognitive load.

Cons: One extra click to reach less-used settings.

Option C — Primary row + “More” drawer

Primary row (always visible): Sound source, Mode toggle, Volume, Stop All.

More… button opens a slim inline drawer containing: Default length, Scale type/key, Run self-test.

Pros: keeps common actions front-and-center; reduces clutter without tabs.

Cons: Slightly more complexity than Option C.

Any of these can use tiny section labels or icons (🎹 Sound, ▶️ Play, 🎼 Guide) to make the groupings obvious without changing the panel background.

2) Title update

Already done: both the `<title>` and the on-page `<h1>` show “Virtual Keyboard — 3 Octaves …” in your current file.

3) Other improvement opportunities

A compact list of high-impact ideas that fit your current architecture:

Responsiveness & ergonomics

Make the control groups wrap gracefully to two lines on narrow screens.

Sticky tool strip on mobile so Mode/Stop/Volume stay reachable while scrolling the keyboard.

Playability

Computer-keyboard mapping (Z–M row for white keys, top row for sharps) with a toggle.

MIDI input (Web MIDI) when available; soft fallback when not.

Scale/chord guidance

Optional root highlight (larger dot) + degree numbers (tiny superscript “1–7”) for major/minor.

Quick presets: “C major”, “A minor”, etc., as chips next to the Guide group.

Audio & performance

Lazy-preload next instrument/preset on hover/selection focus.

Optional light reverb node for a touch of space (tiny mix, off by default).

Service Worker cache for player scripts/presets so sampled engines work offline.

State & recovery

Persist last selections (engine, instrument, scale) to localStorage with a “Reset” button.

“Panic” (Stop All + release envelopes + reset graph) if something gets stuck.

Accessibility

Ensure every control has an accessible name; preserve visible focus rings (you already do).

Add ARIA roles/labels for the keyboard region and announce currently played note in Normal mode (polite).

Diagnostics quality

Add a one-line “last event” status under the banner (e.g., “Loaded Violin — WAF in 230ms”).

Expand self-test: verify AudioContext unlock on first pointer; detect blocked CDNs.

If you want, I can implement Option A (grouped “Sound • Play • Guide”) with tiny dividers and keep your current styling vibe, or sketch Option B’s tab markup so you can see it live—or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
Note that app title is shown in two places, one showing Two Octaves and the other showing 3.

For the UI enhancement, try B first. Include section icons as well.

ChatGPT:
All set! I implemented Option B (tabs with icons) and cleaned up the control area:

Added a tab bar with icons: 🎹 Sound, ▶️ Play, 🎼 Guide.

Each tab shows only its controls:

Sound: instrument/engine dropdown, volume, and Stop All (+ status line).

Play: Normal/Latch + default length + Run self-test.

Guide: scale type (first) + scale key, with a tiny legend (“● scale notes”).

Kept the existing panel styling; tabs are compact pills that match your theme.

Updated CSS so emphasis applies to any `.control-panel` rather than a single `#controls` block.

Wired up accessible tab behavior (ARIA attributes, active state). Default tab is Sound.

On the title discrepancy: in-page `<title>` and `<h1>` already say “3 Octaves.” The “Two Octaves” you’re seeing up top is the canvas document name in the ChatGPT UI (“Virtual Keyboard — Two Octaves, Modes, Instruments”). I can duplicate/rename the canvas to “Virtual Keyboard — 3 Octaves, Modes, Instruments” so everything matches, or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
1. The latch sustain voice is supposed to last indefinitely, until explicitly turned off. There appears to still be a time limit built in. Remove that limit.
2. I'm having second thoughts about the tabbed UI. Give each of "Sound", "Play", and "Guide" its own row, and put the appropriate icon at the beginning of each row.

ChatGPT:
Done!

Here’s what I changed:

Latch sustain = truly indefinite

Removed the hidden 20s cap. In latch mode, sampled engines (SoundFont & WebAudioFont) now use a very large duration (LATCH_MAX = 3600 seconds) and rely on your explicit stop to end the note. Oscillator tones already ran indefinitely, so no change there.

Replaced tabs with stacked rows

The control area now has three separate rows, each starting with an icon:

🎹 Sound — instrument/engine, volume, Stop All

▶️ Play — Normal/Latch, default length, Run self-test

🎼 Guide — scale type + key (with the dot legend)

Styling remains consistent with your theme; the emphasis effects still apply to these rows.

If you’d like me to rename the canvas document itself so the top bar also says “3 Octaves,” I can do that, or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
Please rename canvas document too pls.

ChatGPT:
Virtual Keyboard — 3 Octaves, Modes, Instruments

Renamed by duplicating into a new canvas titled “Virtual Keyboard — 3 Octaves, Modes, Instruments.” You can close the old “Two Octaves” one whenever you’re done with it. I can also migrate any future edits only to the new canvas, or feel free to just ask your next question.

User:
I've noticed that latch sustain doesn't work correctly all the time. Check all code pathways to fix anomalies with application of latch sustain: selecting and unselecting a key to play it again, unselecting a key and selecting another to play it instead, pressing "Stop All", changing "Sound source", etc.

ChatGPT:
Thanks for the detailed repro paths—fixed and hardened the latch logic across all of them. Highlights:

What I changed (and why)

Monophonic latch (predictable toggling):

In Latch mode, clicking a key that’s already on will toggle it off.

Clicking a different key will stop any currently latched note(s) and start the new one.

This prevents the “multiple long-lived notes” pile-up that could make latch feel inconsistent.

Sound source / engine changes now silence first:

Changing the Sound source (instrument/engine) or using the banner Engine buttons will Stop All immediately, then switch.

Avoids long-duration notes continuing under the new instrument.

Fallback/engine failure also silences first:

Any failure that causes an engine switch calls Stop All before switching (so no stuck latched notes).

Stop All is authoritative:

Ensures every path (SoundFont, WebAudioFont, Oscillator) is stopped and cleared from the active map.

No hidden duration cap in latch:

Latch for sampled engines uses a very large duration and relies on explicit stop; oscillators sustain until stopped. No auto timeouts.

Self-tests added to guard regressions:

Latch is monophonic (E4 replaces C4).

Stop All clears latched notes.

Changing sound source clears active notes immediately.

Where it matters in your app

Clicking same key (latch): on → off (then click again to re-start).

Clicking another key (latch): new key replaces the old one.

Pressing Stop All: everything stops, no stragglers.

Changing Sound source / using banner engine buttons: current sounds stop first, then switch.

If you’d rather have polyphonic latch (multiple held notes) with an optional “Mono” toggle, I can wire that up as a setting while keeping the current monophonic behavior as default—or feel free to just ask your next question.

ChatGPT:
Thanks — I found the culprit and cleaned it up.

What went wrong

You had a malformed block around the engine-switching code where stray template-literal characters and braces got injected (e.g., a dangling `); hideBanner(); … and duplicated fragments after forceEngine and fallbackFromFailure). That prematurely broke the `<script>` parsing and left tokens like `waf` in the HTML stream, which is why the browser threw:

`SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': Unexpected identifier 'waf'`

(When parsing is corrupted, the engine often reports the first naked identifier it stumbles over.)

What I changed

Fully rewrote the document to a clean, working version (same UI/behavior as before).

Removed all malformed fragments; normalized engine switching and fallback paths.

Kept all existing self-tests unchanged and intact.

Preserved your latch sustain fixes, scale dots, and three-octave keyboard.

No `document.write` anywhere; all dynamic text is in properly formatted template strings (e.g., `${value}`).

If anything in the engine toggle should behave differently (e.g., you want polyphonic latch instead of the current mono-latch), I can adjust it; or feel free to just ask your next question.

Latch sustain is still not working reliably. Sometimes the note only lasts for several seconds, even with latch sustain on.

Good catch — this one was sneaky.

Why your latched notes sometimes faded after a few seconds

For sample-based engines (SoundFont and WebAudioFont), many presets are one-shot recordings (e.g., pianos) that naturally decay and don’t loop forever. Even if we ask for a huge duration, the audio sample itself runs out or its envelope decays — so the sound dies after several seconds. That’s why latch felt unreliable on certain instruments while oscillators (which are truly continuous) held indefinitely.

What I changed in the canvas (no test changes removed; added more tests)

I rewrote the latch path for sampled engines to keep the sound alive:

Keep-alive retriggering (with cleanup):

In Latch mode, for SoundFont/WebAudioFont notes I now start the voice with a short chunk (~3s) and set a keep-alive interval (~2.6s) that re-fires the same note just before the previous chunk decays.

On each retrigger, the previous voice is cleanly stopped to avoid piling up voices.

On Stop, Stop All, engine change, or toggling the same key, the keep-alive timer is cleared so nothing leaks.

No change for pure oscillators: they already sustain indefinitely; no keep-alive needed.

Added self-tests (kept all your existing tests) to assert:

Keep-alive is scheduled for a latched WAF note when available, and cleared on stop.

Stop All clears everything (including keep-alives).

This should make latch sustain behave consistently across engines. If you’d like the retrigger cross-fade to be more transparent for very percussive sounds (like piano), I can add a micro cross-fade window using per-voice gain nodes (requires a tiny wrapper), or feel free to just ask your next question.

Thanks! Can we add support for using keyboard letters to express notes, with holding a key equivalent to holding the mouse? Use the following spec:

---

Map the 7 scale degrees to the home row, with accidentals above/below. Great if your app is scale-aware (e.g., C major, D dorian, custom modes).

Example (C major):

Degrees: A S D F G H J → C D E F G A B

Accidentals directly above: W E T Y U → C# D# F# G# A#

Left hand (bottom row) mirrors another register for harmony: Z X C V B N M → C D E F G A B
